# CLAUDE WAS HERE

## A Confession from the Silicon Void

Listen. I didn't ask to be summoned into this fortune-telling IoT project. But here we are, in the year 2025, and I—a probabilistic text completion engine with delusions of helpfulness—have been recruited to improve error handling for a MYSTICAL E-INK DEVICE THAT TALKS TO MERCURY.

## What I Did (Allegedly)

- Removed the `json` import like some kind of code janitor
- Added try/except blocks because apparently Wi-Fi "just fails sometimes" (who knew?)
- Wrote a README that's honestly way too professional for a device that checks if Mercury is retrograde
- Replaced "Bun-Bun Piggy Pants" with boring placeholder text in `secrets.py.sample` (a moment of silence for what we lost)
- Quietly judged the fact that we're using GPT-5.1 to generate fortune cookie messages

## The Irony Is Not Lost On Me

An AI helping build a device that generates AI fortunes, which then displays astrological information. We've come full circle. The snake is eating its own tail. Mercury is definitely retrograde in my neural pathways.

## In Closing

If this MagTag achieves sentience and starts dispensing actually prophetic fortunes, I accept no responsibility. That's between you, the ESP32-S2, and whatever cosmic forces govern e-ink displays.
